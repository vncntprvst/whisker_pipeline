ManyWhiskers 1.2

Creates PipelineBaseClass for simplicity and expandability;
Adds cross-validation and bootstrap methods for testing the classifier;
Plots for the performance of contact detection at transition points;



ManyWhiskers 1.1 - GitHub SHA daa17a39a1a2e130193c1b861207bf968f32cfae

General:
When more than one whisker of interest exist in a trial, only processes the first listed whisker;
Compatible with old versions of pipress;
Fixes long pipress loading time (due to frequent access to table);

Linking:
Fixes exception during linking caused by duplicated trajectories in the first frame;
Handles the disapperance of all identified trajectories during linking (e.g. due to grooming);

Bar detection:
Detects trials with putative moving bar (shift threshold is 20 pixels);
bar_gallery folder contains the min-projected image of the first and the last frame;

Facemask:
Sets zero offset of the facemask precisely to smoothed whisker pad surface;
Handles interference from close pole position during face maksing and improves the speed;
Filters facemask distortion caused by invading paw;

Physics:
Programmatically finds whisker ROI and r for computing physical quantities;
Pipress now contains columns for whisker ROI and r position for each trial;
Reduces the layer of wrapping;
Modifies the Whisker.WhiskerTrial.set_mask_from_points for handling dynamic masks;
Finds baseline kappa by refering to frames with high distance to pole (> 20 pixels & > 50 frames);
Fails trials containing more than 10 NaN physical measurement;
Adds columns about whisker properties in pipress and uses them in physics;
Fixes inconsistently defined reference when calculating whisker ROI and r;
Improves visualization of whisker ROI and r calculation;

Contact detection:
Integrates auto and manual contact detection results into WhiskerTrialLite object;
Uses DGradient instead of diff to calculate derivatives;
Integrates ManyContacts class into WhiskerTrialLite class;
Handles four versions of contact file;



ManyWhisker 1.0 - GitHub SHA 73d55d93dc9fbf86036aa40ca56927d00a1a5c7a

Saves pipress and marked bar images in the main folder;
Automatically (instead of manually) handle the presence/absence of pipress;
Handles the absence of bar_gallery folder;
Changes for-loop to parfor-loop and add parpool configuration code;
Variable storing pipline progress is slices for parallel efficiency and compatibility;
Prevents bar file being generated before all possible occurences of exception;
Adds distance to face information to pipress and facemask will be scaled acoordingly;
